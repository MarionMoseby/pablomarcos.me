      <description>In the february post, I mentioned how I ordered the material that was on Carl Schwan&amp;rsquo;s MVP for the Index page, explaining Okular&amp;rsquo;s main features. Now that that was set, I had to add support for i18n, as it can be difficult for translators to work with a raw html template. This was achieved by using the {{i18n}} HUGO template, which specifies the translatable parts by using {{ i18n &amp;quot;Section.variable&amp;quot; }} in each of the strings to translate, and then mapping the values into a yaml file such as:</description>

      <description>I started the month by porting the Anouncements section from Raw HTML to Markdown, for which I wrote a small python script that parses all the content in this news.rdf file, inherited from the old site, and creates several markdown post files that will be processed by the list and single templates of the aether-sass theme into the new section.
 To see the full python script, click here import re text_file = open(&amp;#34;.</description>

      <description>I havent done much this January, as it was the &amp;ldquo;partiels&amp;rdquo; (final exams) month at INSA and I was really caught up studying. I did, however, find time to write the project application, which I have attached below for reference, and I spent what little time I was able to devote to SoK learning how to properly use HUGO and which templates I had to edit to get a given, desired result.</description>

      <description>I participated in the I POSTER COMPETITION at UPM&amp;rsquo;s Language Center, whose theme was: &amp;ldquo;Foreign languages and you: how they have influenced your life&amp;rdquo;. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, I think I got a cute and original poster, which is what I wanted; for another year, I&amp;rsquo;ll check Unsplash better before making decisions 🤓.
Here is my poster:

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml ``` [outputs] home = [&amp;ldquo;HTML&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;JSON&amp;rdquo;] ```</description>
